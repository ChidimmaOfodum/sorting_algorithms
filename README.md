# SORTING ALGORITHM

## Description 

This project includes the implementation of different sorting algorithms: bubble, insertion and selection sort.
At the end of this project, I should be able to explain in clear terms:
- At least four different sorting algorithms
- What the Big O notation is and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
- How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
- What a stable sorting algorithm is. 

## Compilation

``gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic  -std=gnu89``
